\section{Seroprevalence}

1/4 of the world's population have been infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV)

\tab An estimated 250 million people are chronicaly infected putting them at risk for:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Progressive liver disease
    \item Liver cirrhosis
    \item Liver failure
    \item Hepatocellular carcinoma (887,000 deaths per year)
\end{enumerate}

HBV spread through sexual transmission, intravenous drug use, blood transfusion, or vertical transmission at birth

HBV not spread through breastfeeding, sharing utensils, kissing, coughing, or sneezing

\subsection{Chronic Hepatitis B}

The likelihood that hepatitis B will develop from an acute infection to a chronic infection depends on the page of the person infected

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 90\% of infected infants will develop chronic infection
    \item 25-50\% of children between 1 and 5 years old
    \item 5\% of adults will become chronically infected
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Post-Exposure Prophylaxis}

85-95\% effectiveness when administered within 12 hours of birth

Prophylaxis consists of hepatitis B vaccine along with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG)

\subsubsection{Liver Disease}

Chronically infected individuals have a 15-40\% lifetime risk of developing liver cancer

\section{Hepatitis B Virus}

HBV first seen in 1971 and was seen to adopt multiple shapes

3 distinct morphological forms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Most abundant: Small, spherical, noninfectious particles containing HBsAg (Hepatitis B virus surface antigen)
    \item Tubular filaments with a diameter comparable to that of the small particles (Also containing HBsAg)
    \item Dane particle: Hepatitis B virion
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Vaccine}

HBV vaccine was the first licensed vaccine produced by recombinant technology

\tab HBV grown and extracted using yeast cells

Vaccine has a very good record of safety and impact on the disease

\tab HBV prevalence has already been reduced from high to low in immunized cohorts of children

\subsection{Therapies for Treatment of Chronic HBV Infection}

Interferons:

\tab Exact mechanisms aren't fully understood, but it is believed to have both direct antiviral and host immunomodulation effects

Nucleoside Analogs:

\tab Inhibition of HBV polymerase activity resulting in decreased viral replication

\tab Oral medicine with generally mild adverse effects

\subsection{Cancers}

Livery cancer is one the leading causes of cancer deaths worldwide (800,000 deaths anually)

\tab Primary liver cancer is the 8th most common cancer in the works (\(>\)50\% are attributed to HBV)

\subsubsection{Treatment}

Liver transplantation is the gold standard of treatment

\tab Viral reactivation in the graft recipient can be detrimental

High-dose hepatitis B immunoglobulin and anti-viral drugs are remarkably successful at suppressing replication and improving long-term health outcomes
