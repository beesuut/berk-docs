\section{Human Coronaviruses}

The 3 highly pathogenic viruses (causing severe resporatory syndrome)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item SARS-CoV-1
    \item MERS-CoV
    \item SARS-CoV-2
\end{enumerate}

The 4 human coronaviruses (causing mild upper resporatory diseases in immunocompetent hosts)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item HCoV-NL63
    \item HCoV-229E
    \item HCoV-OC43
    \item HCoV-HKU1
\end{enumerate}

Coronavirus (CoV): a large family of viruses that can cause diseases in humans and animals

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2): the strain of virus causing the current pandemic

COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019): the set of symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2

\subsection{Virus Structure}

Corona: Latin for crown

\subsection{ACE2}
ACE-2 is expressed throughout the whole body

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nasal: Initial infection, spread, loss of smell?
    \item Lungs: Pneumonia, ARDS
    \item Heart: Direct infection? Lack of oxygen? Formation of blood clots?
    \item Ileum: Gastrointestinal symptoms, spread
\end{enumerate}

\section{Infection}

ACE-2 (Angiotensin-cinverting enzyme 2) Receptor helps regulate blood pressure but is used to help the viral spike join with the host cell

\subsection{The Initial Week}

The virus lives in the lining of the nose, finding cells expressing ACE-2

Once inside, the virus copies inself and invades new cells

\tab During this time, an infected person may shed much of the virus

Symptoms may be absent, or host will develop a fever, dry cough, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, or head and body aches

\subsection{The Lungs}

If the immune system doesn't control SARS-CoV-2, the virus attacks the lungs where it can become deadly

The thinner, distant branches of the lung's respiratory tree end in tiny air sacs called alveoli

\tab Alveoli are lined by a single layer of cells, rich in ACE-2 receptors

\tab Alveoli are normally used by oxygen, which cross the alveloli into capillaries

\subsection{Pneumonia}

The virus replicates in the alveoli

\tab \indicates As they die, they release inflammatory cytokines and other mediators

\tab \indicates Cytokines and chemokines lead to a buildup of fluid and dead cells (pus)

\subsubsection{Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome}

Although some COVID-19 patient recover, others deteriorate, developing ARDS

Patients commonly end up on ventilators and die

Oxygen levels in blood plummet as their alveoli become stuffed with fluid, white blood cells, mucus, and the detritus of destroyed lung cells

Much of the extreme disease is due to a hyper-activated immune system, rather than a high presences of virally-infected cells

\section{Wastewater}

Wastewater is used as an early warning of future COVID outbreaks due to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 (including asymptomatic) in wastewater samples
