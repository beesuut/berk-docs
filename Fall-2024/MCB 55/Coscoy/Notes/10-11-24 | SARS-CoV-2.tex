\section{SARS-CoV-2}

SARS-CoV-2 Was identified and sequenced in 5 weeks

\subsection{Death and Illness}

Reported 7 million confirmed COVID-indiced deaths worldwide w/ 700 million confirmed cases

\tab Likely 19.1-36 million COVID induced deaths

\tab The US (4\% of population) had over 15\% of the cases

COVID-19 hospitalizations and death are highly dependent on age

\image{COVID By Age}{Age}{COVID-19 hospitalization and death by age}{270pt}

Risk of illness and death from COVID-19 increases due to systemic health and social inequities

Risk of hospitalization affected by other conditions

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Asthma
    \item Hypertension
    \item Obesity
    \item Diabetes
    \item Kidney disease
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Long Covid}

A chronic condition that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months

Estimated at 10-30\% of non-hospitalized cases, 50-70\% of hospitalized cases, and 10-12\% of vaccinated cases

\image{Long Covid Symptoms}{Long Covid}{Symptoms of long Covid}{350pt}

Proposed contributing mechanisms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Viral antigen persistence
    \item Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation
    \item Human herpesvirus reactivation
    \item Dysbiosis
    \item Microvascular dysfunction
    \item SARS-CoV-2-specific and autoreactive immune responses
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Vaccines}

SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines are very effective

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccine
    \item AstraZeneca-Oxford and Covishield chimpanzee-derived adenovirus
    \item Johnson \& Johnson and Janssen human adenovirus (Ad26)
    \item Sinovac and Sinopharm inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus
\end{enumerate}

Approximately 14 billion doses administered worldwide, preventing 15-20 million deaths

In-vitro transcribed mRNA is formulated into lipid nanoparticle using a cell-free production pipeline

\image{In Vitro Transcription}{mRNA Vaccine}{mRNA vaccine formulation}{380pt}

Injected mRNA vaccines are endocytosed by antigen-presenting cells

\tab \indicates By translating the mRNA into protein in the ribosome, the immune system is stimulated

\subsection{Immune Response}

\subsubsection{Neutralization}

Neutralization is one mechanism of antibody function

\tab \indicates Antibodies attatch to spike proteins, so viruses cannot attatch to host cells

\subsubsection{Immune Sensing}

RNA from viruses (or vaccines) are recognized by inate sensors, eliciting the release of cytokines

Early attempts at lipid-mRNA particles resulted in low imunogenicity because they looked like viruses and therefore only created inflammation (production of type I interferons)

\tab \indicates By incorporating modified nucleotides into the mRNA, it strongly reduces the innate immune signaling through decreased activation of TLRs and cytosolic RNA sensors

\subsection{New mRNA Vaccines in Development}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item SARS-CoV-2
    \item Influenza virus
    \item Zika virus
    \item HIV
    \item RSV
    \item Ebola virus
    \item Rabies
    \item Plasmodium gametocyte (Malaria parasite)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Vaccine Innovation}

Most vaccines take years to develop, but multiple vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 were made within a year

How was this possible?

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Coronaviruses were already a concern
    \item The technology was ready
    \item Worldwide collaboration
    \item Funding for vaccine research
    \item Close collaboration between pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies
    \item Very high infection rate in the population and no difficulty recruiting volunteers
\end{enumerate}
