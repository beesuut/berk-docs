\section{Ancient Viruses}

The human genome is mostly made of retrovirus / retrovirus-like DNA

\tab Only 1-2\% of our genomes are genes

\tab Virus-like elements (including endogenous retroviruses) make up almost half our genomes

\subsection{Retroviruses}

\subsubsection{Central Dogma of Biology}

DNA \indicates RNA \indicates Protein

`Retro'viruses go against the central dogma

\subsubsection{Genome Organization}

Simple retrovirus has replicative enzymes:

\tab Reverse Transcriptase (RT) (Turns RNA into DNA)

\tab Integrase (IN) (Insert genome into genome of host cell)

\tab \indicates Retroviruses become a permanent part of the cells they infect

\subsection{Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs)}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Similar genomic organization to exogenous retroviruses
    \item Possess a reverse transcriptase gene
    \item HERVs are `virus fossils'
    \subitem Footprint of prior infection
    \item HERVs are transmitted vertically in the germline through successive generations
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Endogenization of a Virus}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Viruses typically infect `somatic' cells (non-reproductive cells)
    \item Occasional infection of germ line cells leads to transmission to offspring
\end{enumerate}

Endogenous retroviruses (ERV) are derived from different types of exogenous retroviruses (XRV)

\subsection{Koala Retrovirus (KoRV)}

KoRV is a retrovirus currently endogenizing in Koala populations

Virus enters the genome of sperm and egg cells, spreading vertically

\tab Although endogenous retroviruses are normally silent, KoRV is still active

Symptoms include immunodeficiency and cancer

\subsubsection{Transmission}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item KORVs (XRV) are generally transmitted horizontally (in utero, blood, feces, urine, milk, saliva)
    \item KORVs can infect the germline and be inherited (endogenization)
    \item Endogenized KoRVs can reinfect and replicate in the genome
    \subitem can also infect new koalas
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Endogenous Prosimian Immunodeficiency Viruses}

Ancient immunodeficiency virus in primates

Lentiviruses are a type of retrovirus (including HIV)

\tab The type of virus has existed for a long time

\subsection{Endogenous Viral Elements (EVEs)}

Many types of viruses have invaded genomes

\tab Not always retroviruses, but much more rare

\subsection{Co-Option of Viral Sequences}

Some endogenized genes become useless (pseudogene) whereas others get co-opted by the host cell for a cellular function

\subsubsection{Syncitin}

A specialized layer of cells (syncytiotrophoblast layer) at maternal-fetal interface in the placenta

\tab Key to nutrient and waste exchange

\tab Co-opted retroviral envelope
